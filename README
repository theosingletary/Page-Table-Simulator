Edit config.h to change the LEVELS and POBITS.
LEVELS is the number of page table levels.
POBITS is the number of page offset bits.
All integer values of LEVELS between 1 and 6 inclusive and all integer values of POBITS between 4 and 18 inclusive are supported.

This code could be used as a larger part of a simulated operating system or for as an instructional tool to teach students how page tables work.

There are no known bugs or limitations in the code.

This code is not able to write data to data pages, only allocate data pages.

Big-O analysis:
For n levels, time and space complexity are both O(n), for both page_allocate() and translate().
